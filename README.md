# Legal Document Retrieval Solution

## Overview

This solution provides a robust and efficient system for **Legal Document Retrieval** that addresses the complexities of processing legal terms and leverages **Sentence Transformer** models for enhanced semantic understanding. The primary focus is on specialized text processing techniques tailored for legal language and fine-tuning Sentence Transformer models to achieve high accuracy in legal information retrieval tasks.

## Features

- **Legal Term Processing**:
  - Handles long, jargon-heavy sentences common in legal documents.
  - Normalizes legal terms and abbreviations for consistent processing.
  - Supports multilingual legal texts for global applications.

- **Semantic Search**:
  - Uses Sentence Transformer models fine-tuned on legal datasets.
  - Provides accurate retrieval of legal clauses, statutes, and case laws based on user queries.

- **Fine-tuning**:
  - Enhances pre-trained Sentence Transformer models to specialize in legal document retrieval.
  - Employs pairwise ranking and classification to improve query-document relevance.

- **Customizable Workflow**:
  - Modular components allow integration with existing document management systems.
  - Configurable processing pipelines to handle domain-specific requirements.

## Components

### 1. Data Preprocessing

- **Legal Term Normalization**:
  - Maps legal synonyms (e.g., "plaintiff" → "complainant").
  - Expands abbreviations (e.g., "UCC" → "Uniform Commercial Code").

- **Tokenization**:
  - Uses specialized tokenizers to retain the structure of legal language.

- **Stopword Handling**:
  - Includes domain-specific stopword lists to filter irrelevant terms.

- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**:
  - Extracts legal entities like dates, case numbers, and party names for indexing.

### 2. Model Fine-Tuning

- **Dataset**:
  - Prepares a legal corpus with annotated query-document pairs.
  - Example structure:
    - **Queries**: Short legal questions or issues.
    - **Documents**: Relevant statutes, precedents, or legal provisions.

- **Training Objective**:
  - Minimizes ranking loss or contrastive loss to align query-document embeddings.

- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR).
  - Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (nDCG).
  - Precision@k.

### 3. Search Pipeline

- **BM25 for Initial Retrieval**:
  - Quickly identifies a candidate set of documents using lexical similarity.
  
- **Semantic Reranking**:
  - Refines results using fine-tuned Sentence Transformer embeddings for semantic relevance.

- **Query Expansion**:
  - Suggests related legal terms to enhance retrieval scope.
